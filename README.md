# Agricity

Agricity is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to facilitate agricultural transactions and interactions between farmers and consumers. This project leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and efficiency in agricultural supply chains.

## Problem Statement

Agriculture is a vital sector that faces numerous challenges, including lack of access to markets, transparency in transactions, and inefficiencies in supply chains. Agricity aims to address these issues by providing a decentralized platform that connects farmers directly with consumers, ensuring fair prices and reducing intermediaries.

## Core Features and SDG Impact

- **Marketplace**: A platform for farmers to list their products and for consumers to purchase directly, promoting fair trade and reducing food waste.
- **Smart Contracts**: Utilizes blockchain technology to automate transactions, ensuring transparency and trust, which aligns with SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with React for a seamless user experience, making it accessible to all users, including those in rural areas.
- **Empowerment Initiatives**: Focus on empowering women entrepreneurs in agriculture, contributing to SDG 5 (Gender Equality).

## Measurable Outcomes

- Empower 500 women farmers by 2025 through access to the marketplace and resources.
- Increase the income of participating women farmers by 30% within the first year of using the platform.

## Features

- **Marketplace**: A platform for farmers to list their products and for consumers to purchase directly.
- **Smart Contracts**: Utilizes blockchain smart contracts to automate transactions and ensure trust between parties.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with React for a seamless user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
